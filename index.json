The parts came together exactly as planned, with only a few minor issues found. Below, we’ll give you a very brief summary of the ventilator assembly process! We start with the two empty metal enclosure of the ventilator. These are made from folded and welded pieces of 2mm thick Aluminum. The housing is in 2 pieces: a rear metal “shell” (gray) and a front cover plate (white).  Into this shell, we install several cables, 4 rubber feet, and a sliding rail (not shown) along the bottom.  Next, you prepare the “tray” subassembly, where all of the Inspiratory-side components of the ventilator are located. For ease of manufacturing, the “tray” is just a flat piece of sheet metal to which most of the ventilator components are attached, allowing the freedom to do most of the assembly work outside of the enclosure. Two fully assembled “trays” are shown below.  The “tray” is then simply dropped into the ventilator shell, and secured with 11 screws:  After this, the Expiratory “cartridge” has to be built as a separate subassembly. This is a self-contained metal cartridge that slides in and out of the bottom section of the ventilator. Once the cartridge is assembled and inserted into the ventilator, it looks like this:  The above picture shows the Expiratory Cartridge with its metal cover removed. With the metal cover in place, it looks like this.  At this point, the rear of the ventilator looks like:  Finally, all that remains is to install the electronic PCBs (not shown), attach the LCD and speakers to the front cover, attach the front cover the ventilator, and voila! - you have a ventilator! Altogether, we are very pleased, as it has turned out to be one of the most very straightforward and intuitive product assembly processes we’ve seen on an advanced medical product! There are a handful of small improvements to make, but we are confident we can knock those out in a single minor iteration of the design. Check out the finished product, below! (BTW - the total ventilator weight came out to around 9 kg, close to what we predicted.)  So…. what’s next? Now comes the fun part… testing, testing, testing! We are in the process of migrating our software and electronics from the bench-prototypes to run on these machines. We should be able to demonstrate ventilation using these two prototypes within a week or two. In parallel, we are working on the mechanical and electrical design improvements for the next iteration, which we should be ready to build in January. If you like our work, and would like to help us bring ventilators to developing parts of the world, please consider supporting us. Thank you!

Respiraworks is a talented group of engineers and designers who started work on a low-cost ventilator design in March 2020, just a few weeks before Project RED. We exchanged ideas and learned a lot through discussions with Respiraworks, and in fact a key piece of technology we use in the RED ventilator was created by Respiraworks, the “pinch-valve” actuator. Early in the project, we explored several different approaches for controlling expiratory flow and maintaining PEEP pressure, but found various tradeoffs and limitations with the methods we tried. Respiraworks came up with a clever and cost-effective solution to this problem with their custom pinch-valve, based on a low-cost stepper motor typically used for 3D printing and CNC applications. Given that their project is open-source, they were happy to share the design with us, which we then adapted for the RED design. Two images of the pinch valve are shown below: the first is the original pinch valve designed by Respiraworks, and the second is the design with some changes made to adapt it to the RED design.  We encourage you to check out Respiraworks’ project in addition to Project RED. The design principle of their ventilator is similar to ours, though there are various differences in the implementation details and licensing approach. We believe that many different and parallel efforts will be needed to increase global supply of ventilators to where it needs to be. Kudos to Respiraworks for their ingenuity and spirit of engineering collaboration!

HLH also provided us a DFM (design for manufacturability) report stating that there are no major manufacturability concerns, and this design can readily be scaled up to manufacturing hundreds or thousands of units without any problem. This is great news, and is a testament to the close attention to detail and many review cycles we underwent during the mechanical CAD design. The fabricated parts include sheet metal pieces, machined polycarbonate blocks, machined aluminum, and 3D printed ABS parts. Some photos are posted below.  Our next step is to put together 4 finished ventilator units, and we plan to do this before the end of November. Two units will be assembled in California, and two units will be assembled with our partner in Nepal, Paaila Technology. On the software side, we recently achieved a significant milestone where the GUI processor is now talking to the ventilation processor, and we can control ventilation functions directly from the GUI (rather than from a debug console)! You can see a video of this below.    (One comment on the video: the first two breaths delivered are “test breaths” where the machine measures the elasticity of the patients’ lungs… it’s not a bug. Another comment, it sounds a lot louder in the video than it is in real life.  ). As the COVID-19 crisis continues to spread, we’re working hard to make our low-cost ventilator a reality, so we can license the design to countries that need to scale up their supply of this essential technology. While we are seeking grants, at the moment this project is mostly self-funded, so we appreciate any support you can offer! And if you are interested in a collaboration, or in licensing our technology, please contact us.

Apologies that we have not issued a project update in a while, but we have been very busy with ventilator development! And a lot has happened in the past three months. After three months of close work with our friends at Paaila Technology, we have finished the complete mechanical CAD design of the RED-1 ventilator. Below are some pictures showing the external and internal appearance of the ventilator. We were able to achieve an appearance and style very similar to the concept drawing we started with. We have also partnered with a manufacturing company in China (HLH Prototypes) who will be making the first ventilator prototypes for us based on this design. We've already released parts to them to start producing the first few ventilators.  (For a more detailed walk through the internals of the ventilator, jump ahead to the next section)  In August, we built three new bench-top ventilator systems for use in software development. A picture of the three systems, and a video of one of them up and running, are below.    Also, software development is going extremely well. We worked closely with ICS to come up with a flexible, extensible communication protocol between the ventilator microprocessor and the GUI processor. This protocol allows us to easily re-configure the GUI design to accommodate new modes of ventilation in the future. Initially, we plan to implement Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) and Pressure Regulated Volume Control (PRVC) modes, but soon after we plan to deploy additional modes such as PSV and SIMV. A video of our GUI, running and plotting real data gathered from one of our prototypes, is below:    By November we expect to have several fully functional ventilators running in the actual ventilator enclosure! Ventilator Design Walkthrough  We developed the mechanical internals of the ventilator in a modular fashion. There are custom blocks to handle specific functions, such as air filtering, O2 metering, gas mixing, safety valves, etc. We also focused heavily on ease-of-manufacturing. The major components of the design are shown below: The Blower Module, O2 Manifold, Gas Mixing Manifold, Insp Manifold, and Exp Manifold are all custom sub-assemblies designed by Project RED engineers. Some closer views of these design blocks are provided below.\nWe placed a lot of thought into making the ventilator easy to build. A key feature in this regard is that all of the Inspiratory components are located on a removable metal “tray”:  The tray has pressed-in (PEM) nuts and standoffs, so a technician can simply screw down the sub-modules to the tray, attach tubes and clamps, and then drop the tray into the enclosure shell. The enclosure shell also has pressed-in standoffs for accepting the tray. The enclosure shell is made of 2mm thick aluminum sheet metal, bent and seam-welded together, so it should be extremely rugged. The enclosure is shown below:  Another important feature of the design is the “Expiratory Cartridge.” The Expiratory cartridge handles all exhaled gas from a patient, and lives on a sliding rail so it can be removed from the ventilator. This is because exhaled gas from the patient may be contaminated; therefore, it is good practice to keep the expiratory circuits isolated from the inspiratory circuits, to prevent contamination of the ventilator. (Normally an external bacterial/viral filter should also be used on the expiratory limb of the patient circuit). All expired gases are contained within tubing inside the Expiratory cartridge, and then filtered again before leaving the cartridge. In case there are small leaks within the tubing in the cartridge, there is a sheet metal cover for the cartridge which greatly reduces the risk of contaminants entering the upper part of the ventilator. For decontamination purposes, the cartridge can be detached from the ventilator and sent for cleaning. Since the Expiratory cartridge has electronics on it, we had to develop a solution for mating/de-mating an electronic connector when the cartridge was inserted or removed. Maintaining alignment of the connector halves was a tricky problem, but we believe we have a solution that will work, and we will be testing it when the first prototype units come back next month. The Expiratory cartridge is shown (both with and without cover) below.  Finally, there is a simple subassembly for the front-cover, which consists of sheet metal, two speakers, an LED light bar, the LCD touchscreen, and some simple brackets:  All in all we are very pleased with how the design has turned out, and we can’t wait to test the first few units in November. The best news, perhaps, is that after pricing out most of the custom mechanical parts, we are quite confident that this ventilator can be built for well under $4000 USD, even at relatively small quantities (100 units or less) !
