The ventilator will have a vibrant, 10.1\" color LCD touchscreen as the main interface. The display\ris tilted at a 70 degree angle to optimize visibility and touchscreen access. The inhale and exhale breathing ports\rare on the right side. The overall size is approximately 14 x 10 x 7 inches, about the size of a small briefcase,\rand it will be readily portable.

Recently we demonstrated two critical features: active electronic control of PEEP and Air/O2 mixing. We are\ralso making great progress on our UI design, with the help of our talented UI/UX design partner, ICS (www.ics.com).\rAttached is a screen shot of the ventilation UI. It is clear and intuitive, and when paired with our 10.1\", 1280x800\rIPS LCD screen, will be clearly visible from across the room. We think it will be one of the best ventilator UIs out\rthere!\r","permalink":"https://redventilator.org/blog/5/","tags":null,"title":"UI/UX Design"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\rHi all, today is a big milestone for our ventilator development. We successfully demonstrated mixing Air \u0026 O2 to a\rtarget ratio (FiO2)! This is a critically important feature for the ventilator to have. The ventilator mixes room\rair with O2 from a compressor. Attached is a data trace showing some data we recorded during our mixing test. In the\rcenter plot, you can see the flow of O2 in blue, the flow of air in yellow, and the total gas flow in green. In the\rbottom plot you can see the integrated volumes of air, O2, and total gas volume. In this test we are mixing to an\rFiO2 of 86%, but we've successfully mixed to several other ratios as well.\r\rHere is a real-time video of our ventilator diagnostic program, showing how we can\rmix air and oxygen to a target ratio (also called \"FiO2.\") There's a lot going on this screen, so pay attention\rmostly to the second and third plot from the top, and the user entry box called \"FiO2\" on the left hand panel. You\rcan see when the user changes the \"FiO2\" setting in the left hand panel, the flow levels for air (yellow) and O2\r(blue) change in the second plot. The third plot shows the integrated volumes for air, O2, and total volume. You can\rsee that the mix ratio tracks the user's input. There's still some fine-tuning required, but this is an important\rproof of concept demo!\r  ","permalink":"https://redventilator.org/blog/4/","tags":null,"title":"FiO2 Mixing Demonstration"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\rOK we wanted to post another update showing a bit more about how our prototype ventilator is working.\r\rIn this video, Edward shows how our ventilator is able to to track a pressure target curve by controlling the speed\rof our blower, and also hit a specific volume target (Vt=200mL) by adjusting the peak pressure on each breath. This\ralgorithm is also called \"PRVC\" and is a widely accepted method of ventilating patients as their lung conditions\rchange over time.\r\rIn parallel, we are actively working on updates to the pneumatic, electronic, mechanical and industrial design of\rthe unit.

We are working on\rtuning the control loops, testing different tidal volumes and patient conditions, and additional hardware/software\rintegration tasks. In this video you can see several basic closed-loop pressure controlled breaths occurring. The\rcontrol loop is not fully tuned yet, but we are still able to regulate the inspiratory pressure to around 40 cmH20\r(this is very high for a patient scenario, but that's the test case where we took the video :) ) We regulate the\rpatient pressure by rapidly varying the speed of our air blower, which has a very fast dynamic response.
