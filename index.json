[{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\rHello Project RED supporters,\rWe’ve finished assembling our first 2 full ventilators in our home office/lab here in northern California, and\roverall the process went like a dream! The parts came together exactly as planned, with only a few minor issues\rfound. Below, we’ll give you a very brief summary of the ventilator assembly process!\rWe start with the two empty metal enclosure of the ventilator. These are made from folded and welded pieces of 2mm\rthick Aluminum. The housing is in 2 pieces: a rear metal “shell” (gray) and a front cover plate (white).\r\rInto this shell, we install several cables, 4 rubber feet, and a sliding rail (not shown) along the bottom.\r\rNext, you prepare the “tray” subassembly, where all of the Inspiratory-side components of the ventilator are\rlocated. For ease of manufacturing, the “tray” is just a flat piece of sheet metal to which most of the ventilator\rcomponents are attached, allowing the freedom to do most of the assembly work outside of the enclosure. Two fully\rassembled “trays” are shown below.\r\rThe “tray” is then simply dropped into the ventilator shell, and secured with 11 screws:\r\rAfter this, the Expiratory “cartridge” has to be built as a separate subassembly. This is a self-contained metal\rcartridge that slides in and out of the bottom section of the ventilator. Once the cartridge is assembled and\rinserted into the ventilator, it looks like this:\r\rThe above picture shows the Expiratory Cartridge with its metal cover removed. With the metal cover in place, it\rlooks like this.\r\rAt this point, the rear of the ventilator looks like:\r\rFinally, all that remains is to install the electronic PCBs (not shown), attach the LCD and speakers to the front\rcover, attach the front cover the ventilator, and voila! - you have a ventilator!\rAltogether, we are very pleased, as it has turned out to be one of the most very straightforward and intuitive\rproduct assembly processes we’ve seen on an advanced medical product! There are a handful of small improvements to\rmake, but we are confident we can knock those out in a single minor iteration of the design. Check out the finished\rproduct, below! (BTW - the total ventilator weight came out to around 9 kg, close to what we predicted.)\r\rSo…. what’s next? Now comes the fun part… testing, testing, testing! We are in the process of\rmigrating our software and electronics from the bench-prototypes to run on these machines. We should be able to\rdemonstrate ventilation using these two prototypes within a week or two. In parallel, we are working on the\rmechanical and electrical design improvements for the next iteration, which we should be ready to build in January.\rIf you like our work, and would like to help us bring ventilators to developing parts of the world, please consider\rsupporting us. Thank you!\r","permalink":"https://redventilator.org/blog/9/","tags":null,"title":"First 2 Ventilators Built!"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\rWe wanted to give a special acknowledgement to another non-profit team that is working on a low-cost ventilator, Respiraworks. Respiraworks is a talented group of engineers\rand designers who started work on a low-cost ventilator design in March 2020, just a few weeks before Project RED.\rWe exchanged ideas and learned a lot through discussions with Respiraworks, and in fact a key piece of technology we\ruse in the RED ventilator was created by Respiraworks, the “pinch-valve” actuator.\rEarly in the project, we explored several different approaches for controlling expiratory flow and maintaining PEEP\rpressure, but found various tradeoffs and limitations with the methods we tried. Respiraworks came up with a clever\rand cost-effective solution to this problem with their custom pinch-valve, based on a low-cost stepper motor\rtypically used for 3D printing and CNC applications. Given that their project is open-source, they were happy to\rshare the design with us, which we then adapted for the RED design.\rTwo images of the pinch valve are shown below: the first is the original pinch valve designed by Respiraworks, and\rthe second is the design with some changes made to adapt it to the RED design.\r\rWe encourage you to check out Respiraworks’ project in addition to Project RED. The design principle of their\rventilator is similar to ours, though there are various differences in the implementation details and licensing\rapproach. We believe that many different and parallel efforts will be needed to increase global supply of\rventilators to where it needs to be. Kudos to Respiraworks for their ingenuity and spirit of engineering\rcollaboration!\r","permalink":"https://redventilator.org/blog/10/","tags":null,"title":"A Note of Thanks"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\rHello Project RED supporters,\rWe’ve completed fabricating the first 4 sets of “pre-production” ventilator parts with our manufacturing partner,\rHLH Prototypes, and the fabrication went off with\ralmost zero issues!\r“Pre-production” means that these are the part designs we plan to use in the final production ventilator, but we\rassume there will be some small issues found and tweaks made between now and then. HLH also provided us a DFM\r(design for manufacturability) report stating that there are no major manufacturability concerns, and this design\rcan readily be scaled up to manufacturing hundreds or thousands of units without any problem. This is great news,\rand is a testament to the close attention to detail and many review cycles we underwent during the mechanical CAD\rdesign.\rThe fabricated parts include sheet metal pieces, machined polycarbonate blocks, machined aluminum, and 3D printed\rABS parts. Some photos are posted below.\r\rOur next step is to put together 4 finished ventilator units, and we plan to do this before the end of November. Two\runits will be assembled in California, and two units will be assembled with our partner in Nepal, Paaila Technology.\rOn the software side, we recently achieved a significant milestone where the GUI processor is now talking to the\rventilation processor, and we can control ventilation functions directly from the GUI (rather than from a debug\rconsole)! You can see a video of this below.\r  \r(One comment on the video: the first two breaths delivered are “test breaths” where the machine measures the\relasticity of the patients’ lungs… it’s not a bug. Another comment, it sounds a lot louder in the video than it is\rin real life.  ).\rAs the COVID-19 crisis continues to spread, we’re working hard to make our low-cost ventilator a reality, so we can\rlicense the design to countries that need to scale up their supply of this essential technology. While we are\rseeking grants, at the moment this project is mostly self-funded, so we appreciate any support you can offer! And if\ryou are interested in a collaboration, or in licensing our technology, please contact us.\r","permalink":"https://redventilator.org/blog/8/","tags":null,"title":"First Sets of Parts Manufactured"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\rHello Project RED supporters!\rApologies that we have not issued a project update in a while, but we have been very busy with ventilator\rdevelopment! And a lot has happened in the past three months.\rAfter three months of close work with our friends at Paaila Technology, we have finished the complete mechanical CAD\rdesign of the RED-1 ventilator. Below are some pictures showing the external and internal appearance of the\rventilator. We were able to achieve an appearance and style very similar to the concept drawing we started with. We\rhave also partnered with a manufacturing company in China (HLH Prototypes) who will be making the first ventilator\rprototypes for us based on this design. We've already released parts to them to start producing the first few\rventilators.\r\r(For a more detailed walk through the internals of the ventilator, jump ahead to the next section)\r\rIn August, we built three new bench-top ventilator systems for use in software development. A picture of the three\rsystems, and a video of one of them up and running, are below.\r  \rAlso, software development is going extremely well. We worked closely with ICS to come up with a flexible,\rextensible communication protocol between the ventilator microprocessor and the GUI processor. This protocol allows\rus to easily re-configure the GUI design to accommodate new modes of ventilation in the future. Initially, we plan\rto implement Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) and Pressure Regulated Volume Control (PRVC) modes, but soon after\rwe plan to deploy additional modes such as PSV and SIMV.\rA video of our GUI, running and plotting real data gathered from one of our prototypes, is below:\r  \rBy November we expect to have several fully functional ventilators running in the actual ventilator enclosure!\rVentilator Design Walkthrough\r\rWe developed the mechanical internals of the ventilator in a modular fashion. There are custom blocks to handle\rspecific functions, such as air filtering, O2 metering, gas mixing, safety valves, etc. We also focused heavily on\rease-of-manufacturing. The major components of the design are shown below:\rThe Blower Module, O2 Manifold, Gas Mixing Manifold, Insp Manifold, and Exp Manifold are all custom sub-assemblies\rdesigned by Project RED engineers. Some closer views of these design blocks are provided below.\nWe placed a lot of thought into making the ventilator easy to build. A key feature in this regard is that all of the\rInspiratory components are located on a removable metal “tray”:\r\rThe tray has pressed-in (PEM) nuts and standoffs, so a technician can simply screw down the sub-modules to the tray,\rattach tubes and clamps, and then drop the tray into the enclosure shell. The enclosure shell also has pressed-in\rstandoffs for accepting the tray. The enclosure shell is made of 2mm thick aluminum sheet metal, bent and\rseam-welded together, so it should be extremely rugged. The enclosure is shown below:\r\rAnother important feature of the design is the “Expiratory Cartridge.” The Expiratory cartridge handles all exhaled\rgas from a patient, and lives on a sliding rail so it can be removed from the ventilator. This is because exhaled\rgas from the patient may be contaminated; therefore, it is good practice to keep the expiratory circuits isolated\rfrom the inspiratory circuits, to prevent contamination of the ventilator. (Normally an external bacterial/viral\rfilter should also be used on the expiratory limb of the patient circuit). All expired gases are contained within\rtubing inside the Expiratory cartridge, and then filtered again before leaving the cartridge. In case there are\rsmall leaks within the tubing in the cartridge, there is a sheet metal cover for the cartridge which greatly reduces\rthe risk of contaminants entering the upper part of the ventilator. For decontamination purposes, the cartridge can\rbe detached from the ventilator and sent for cleaning.\rSince the Expiratory cartridge has electronics on it, we had to develop a solution for mating/de-mating an\relectronic connector when the cartridge was inserted or removed. Maintaining alignment of the connector halves was a\rtricky problem, but we believe we have a solution that will work, and we will be testing it when the first prototype\runits come back next month.\rThe Expiratory cartridge is shown (both with and without cover) below.\r\rFinally, there is a simple subassembly for the front-cover, which consists of sheet metal, two speakers, an LED\rlight bar, the LCD touchscreen, and some simple brackets:\r\rAll in all we are very pleased with how the design has turned out, and we can’t wait to test the first few units in\rNovember. The best news, perhaps, is that after pricing out most of the custom mechanical parts, we are quite\rconfident that this ventilator can be built for well under $4000 USD, even at relatively small quantities (100 units\ror less) !\r","permalink":"https://redventilator.org/blog/7/","tags":null,"title":"CAD Design Complete!"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\rHello Project Red supporters, we have a concept drawing of what we are planning for our ventilator design.

We successfully demonstrated mixing Air \u0026 O2 to a\rtarget ratio (FiO2)! This is a critically important feature for the ventilator to have.

In the\rcenter plot, you can see the flow of O2 in blue, the flow of air in yellow, and the total gas flow in green. In the\rbottom plot you can see the integrated volumes of air, O2, and total gas volume. In this test we are mixing to an\rFiO2 of 86%, but we've successfully mixed to several other ratios as well.\r\rHere is a real-time video of our ventilator diagnostic program, showing how we can\rmix air and oxygen to a target ratio (also called \"FiO2.\") There's a lot going on this screen, so pay attention\rmostly to the second and third plot from the top, and the user entry box called \"FiO2\" on the left hand panel. You\rcan see when the user changes the \"FiO2\" setting in the left hand panel, the flow levels for air (yellow) and O2\r(blue) change in the second plot.
