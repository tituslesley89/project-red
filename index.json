[{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\rOK we wanted to post another update showing a bit more about how our prototype ventilator is working.\r\rIn this video, Edward shows how our ventilator is able to to track a pressure target curve by controlling the speed\rof our blower, and also hit a specific volume target (Vt=200mL) by adjusting the peak pressure on each breath. This\ralgorithm is also called \"PRVC\" and is a widely accepted method of ventilating patients as their lung conditions\rchange over time.\r\rIn parallel, we are actively working on updates to the pneumatic, electronic, mechanical and industrial design of\rthe unit. Thanks for your support!\r  ","permalink":"http://www.tituslesley89.com/blog/3/","tags":null,"title":"PRVC Demonstration"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\rOur ventilator prototype has been up and breathing under software control for the past few days. We are working on\rtuning the control loops, testing different tidal volumes and patient conditions, and additional hardware/software\rintegration tasks. In this video you can see several basic closed-loop pressure controlled breaths occurring. The\rcontrol loop is not fully tuned yet, but we are still able to regulate the inspiratory pressure to around 40 cmH20\r(this is very high for a patient scenario, but that's the test case where we took the video :) ) We regulate the\rpatient pressure by rapidly varying the speed of our air blower, which has a very fast dynamic response. So far\rthings are looking really good!\r  ","permalink":"http://www.tituslesley89.com/blog/2/","tags":null,"title":"Alpha Prototype"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\rOur ventilator design is based on a high-speed blower which is capable of providing the pressure and flow necessary\rto ventilate a patient's lungs. Attached video is from our testing in the first 2 weeks of the project, showing how\rthe blower can inflate and maintain a target pressure within the lung.\r  \r\rHere's a photo of our initial prototype electronics platform, completed first week of May, ready for integration\rwith the pneumatics.\r\r\rWith the help of our awesome Canadian mechanical engineers we developed this custom plastic manifold, used for\rcombining air and oxygen in the proper fractions before delivering it to the patient.\r\r\rVery happy to share, we finished our first hardware prototype system on 8-May, now over to software to make it\rbreathe!\r","permalink":"http://www.tituslesley89.com/blog/1/","tags":null,"title":"Concept"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\r\nEdward is an embedded systems engineer with over 15 years experience designing products for the commercial, medical, and space industries, and is currently a Senior Engineer at Amazon Lab126.
